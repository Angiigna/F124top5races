            2. British Grand Prix - Hamilton's ressurgence
          </h2>
          <p class="justification">
            Lewis Hamilton's historic ninth win at Silverstone, marking his first victory since 2021, was a monumental moment. It looked like Lando was gonna win his first homerace for a while, but rain soaked his part. The race's wet-dry conditions further amplified the excitement, with strategic tire choices playing a crucial role.

            3. Italian Grand Prix - Monza is red
          </h2>
          <p class="justification">
            Charles Leclerc's triumph at Monza, delivering Ferrari's first home victory since 2019, electrified the Tifosi. The team's bold one-stop strategy paid off, and McLaren's strong performance added to the race's intensity. The last few laps with Charles driving on his old tyres being chased by Piastri on new tyres was a nail biter.

          </h2>
          <p class="justification">
